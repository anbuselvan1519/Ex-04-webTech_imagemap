                Mangadu is known for the temple of "Tapas Kamakshi" or Goddess Kamakshi performing penance in Fire. This is the place where the goddess performed her penance to marry and re-unite with Lord Shiva. [1] All 32 types of Dharmic rituals were performed here by the goddess.The background is that when Lord Shiva and Parvati where in Mount Kailash the Goddess playfully closed the eyes of the Lord Shiva and as a result the whole universe fell into eternal darkness. So the Lord ordained her to perform Tapasya.The Goddess came down to this place and performed penance amidst "Panchagni" resting her left leg on the sacred fire and folding her right leg. She holds a "Japamala" in her hand as she meditated on Lord Shiva who asked her to come to Kanchipuram for marriage.[2]
